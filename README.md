immudb is a **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** with built-in cryptographic proof and verification.
With immudb, you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a
tamperproof immudb database.
<img align="right" src="img/immudb-mascot-small.png" width="256px"/>

Traditional DB transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable, so there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.
immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retroactively** of changes to your sensitive data, even
if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using **cryptographic data structures** internally.
This allows you to keep a persistent history of sensitive data, such as debit/credit card transactions.

immudb has 4 main benefits:

1. **immudb is immutable**. You can add records, but **never change or delete records**. This lets you store critical data without fear of it being changed silently.
2. Data stored in immudb is **cryptographically coherent and verifiable**, like blockchains, just without all the complexity and at high speed.
3. Anyone can get **started with immudb in minutes**. Whether you're using node.js, Java, Python, Go, .Net, or any other language. It's very easy to use and you can have your immutable database running in just a few minutes.
4. Finally, immudb is **Open Source**. You can run it **on premise**, or in the **cloud**. It's completely free. immudb is governed by the Apache 2.0 License.

immudb can be ran on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **Windows**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

## Using immudb

Lot of useful documentation and step by step guides can be found at https://docs.immudb.io/

### Real world examples

We already learned about the following use cases from users:

- use immudb to immutably store every update to sensitive database fields (credit card or bank account data) of an existing application database
- store CI/CD recipes in immudb to protect build and deployment pipelines
- store public certificates in immudb
- use immudb as an additional hash storage for digital objects checksums
- store log streams (i. e. audit logs) tamperproof

### Companies using immudb

[eSoftThings ](https://www.esoftthings.com/en/)

[Greentube](https://www.greentube.com/)

[TA Capital](http://www.ta.capital)

[tinaba](https://www.tinaba.bancaprofilo.it/)

Integrate immudb into your application using official SDKs already available for the following programming languages:

1. Java [immudb4j](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j)
2. Golang [immudb-go](https://docs.immudb.io/immudb/golang.html)
3. .net [immudb4dotnet](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4dotnet)
4. Python [immudb-py](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-py)
5. Node.js [immudb-node](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-node)

We've developed a "language-agnostic SDK" which exposes a REST API for easy consumption by any application.
[immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) may be convenient tool when SDKs are not available for the
programming language you're using, for experimentation, or just because you prefer your app only uses REST endpoints.

## Quickstart

Getting immudb up and running is quite simple. For a super quick start, please follow step by step guides for each SDK or pick a basic running sample from [immudb-client-examples](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-client-examples). Otherwise, you can use the immudb CLI tools described below.

- **immuclient** is the CLI client for immudb. You can read, write data into immudb from the commandline using direct or interactive mode.
- **immuadmin** is the admin CLI for immudb. You can manage immudb and get statistics as well as runtime information.

### Binary

Download latest release binaries from [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases). Then just run immudb as follows:

```bash
./immudb
```

You can connect to the default database with immuclient by first running the interactive shell, then logging into the `immudb` database with the password `immudb`:

```bash
./immuclient

immuclient> login immudb
Password: immudb
immuclient> 
```

For more information, run `immuclient --help` to see all options.

### Docker

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 3322:3322 -p 9497:9497 --name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest
```

immudb should be up and running, you can check the container logs:

```bash
docker logs immudb
```

To perform actions, simply run ```./immuclient``` on the same machine or ```./immuclient -a <immudb-host>```. You can also find immuclient in the immudb container at `/usr/local/bin/immuadmin` or run a Docker container to connect to the local or remote immudb with `docker run -it --rm --name immuclient codenotary/immuclient:latest -a <immudb-host>`

To manage the database, simply run ```./immuadmin``` on the same machine. You can also find immuadmin in the immudb container at `/usr/local/bin/immuadmin` or run a Docker container to connect to the local immudb with `docker run -it --rm --name immuadmin codenotary/immuadmin:latest status`. For security reasons we recommend using immuadmin only on the same system as immudb. User management is restricted to localhost usage.
