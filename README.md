immudb is **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** for systems and applications. With immmudb you can
track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes indelibly in a the
tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of, say, your debit/credit transactions.
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/blob/master/img/immudb-mascot-small.png" width="256px"/>

Traditional transaction logs are hard to scale, and are not immutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.

As such immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retro-actively**, of what happened to your sensitive data, even
if your perimiter was compromised. immudb provides the guarantatee of immutability by using internally a **Merkle tree structure**.

immudb gives you the same **cyrptographic verification** of the integrity of data written with **SHA-256** like classic blockhain without the cost and complexity associated with blockhains today.

immudb has 4 main benefits:

1. **immudb is immutable**. You can only add records, but **never change or delete records**.
2. data stored in immudb is **cryptographically coherent and verifiable**, like blockchains, just without all the complexity and at high speed.
3. Anyone can get **started with immudb in minutes**. Wether in node.js, Java, Python, Golang, .Net, or any other language. It's very easy to use and you can have your immutable database running in just a few minutes.
4. Finally, immudb is  **Open Source**. You can run it **on premise**, or in the **cloud** and it's completely free. immudb is governed by the Apache 2.0 License.

immudb is currently runs on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **Windows**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

## What does it look like?

![immudb Highlevel](img/highlevel.png "immudb highlevel overview")

### High level features

#### Simplified API for safe SET/GET
single API call that performs all steps and returns the proofs directly.

#### REST gateway (for legacy systems)
A gRPC REST gateway is a reverse proxy that sits in the middle between the gRPC API and the application.

Other than simply converting the gRPC API to a REST interface, this component will have a built-in verification on query results and will return the verification result directly.

This solution is completely transparent: the client application can use just one endpoint (the REST interface) to perform all operations.
The REST gateway can be also embedded into the immudb binary directly.

#### Driver for common languages
Driver available for:
1. Java
2. .net
3. Golang
4. Python
5. Node.js

#### Structured value
The Any message type of protobuffer allows to lets you use messages as embedded types without having their .proto definition. Thus it’s possible to decouple and extend (in future) the value structure.
Value can be augmented with some client provided metadata. That also permits to use an on-demand serialization/deserialization strategy

#### Item References
enables the insertion of a special entry which references to another item

#### Value timestamp
The server should not set the timestamp, to avoid relying on a not verifiable “single source of truth”.
Thus the clients have to provide it. The client driver implementation can automatically do that for the user.

#### Primary Index
Index enables queries and search based on the data key

#### Secondary Index
Index enables queries and search based on the data value

#### Cryptographic signatures
A signature (PKI) provided by the client can be became part of the insertion process

#### Authentication (transport)
integrated mTLS offers the best approach for machine-to-machine authentication, also providing communications security (entryption) over the transport channel

## Quickstart


### Performance monitoring (Prometheus)

immudb has a built-in prometheus exporter that publishes all metrics at port 9497 (:9497/metrics) by default. When running a Prometheus instance, you can configure the target like in this example:

```
  - job_name: 'immudbmetrics'
    scrape_interval: 60s
    static_configs:
         - targets: ['my-immudb-server:9497']

```
#### Grafana

There is a Grafana dashboard available as well: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12026
