# immudb [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/codenotary/immudb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/codenotary/immudb) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/codenotary/immudb)](LICENSE) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/codenotary/immudb)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/codenotary/immudb) <img align="right" src="img/Black%20logo%20-%20no%20background.png" width="160px"/> 

immudb is a **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** for systems and applications. With immmudb you can
track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a
tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of sensitive data, for example debit/credit card transactions.
<img align="right" src="img/immudb-mascot-small.png" width="256px"/>

Traditional transaction logs are hard to scale and are mutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.

As such, immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retroactively** of changes to your sensitive data, even
if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using a **Merkle tree structure** internally.

immudb gives you the same **cryptographic verification** of the integrity of data written with **SHA-256** like a classic blockchain without the cost and complexity associated with blockchains today.

immudb has 4 main benefits:

1. **immudb is immutable**. You can add records, but **never change or delete records**.
2. Data stored in immudb is **cryptographically coherent and verifiable**, like blockchains, just without all the complexity and at high speed.
3. Anyone can get **started with immudb in minutes**. Whether you're using node.js, Java, Python, Golang, .Net, or any other language. It's very easy to use and you can have your immutable database running in just a few minutes.
4. Finally, immudb is  **Open Source**. You can run it **on premise**, or in the **cloud**. It's completely free. immudb is governed by the Apache 2.0 License.

immudb can be ran on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **Windows**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

## Quickstart

### Components

- **immudb** is the server binary that listens on port 3322 on localhost and provides a gRPC interface
- **immugw** is the intelligent REST proxy that connects to immudb and provides a RESTful interface for applications. We recommend to run immudb and immugw on separate machines to enhance security
- **immuadmin** is the admin CLI for immudb and immugw. You can install and manage the service installation for both components and get statistics as well as runtime information.

The latest release binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases )

## Why immudb

immudb has been developed with performance, scalability and versatility in mind. The user feedback has shown that they love the very high throughput and being able to store hashes as well as data. They see it as a great alternative to using a blockchain or ledger service.

That makes immudb fit to store changes to other database fields (like Microsoft SQL or MongoDB) in a tamperproof fashion. 

You can find an example video here:

[![With immudb you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes indelibly in a the tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of, say, your debit/credit transactions.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/rQ4iZAM14m0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ4iZAM14m0 "track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases")

As immudb is compared to Amazon QLDB as well, we compared the performance using a simple demo  application to write data (without using any unfair optimization).

## News

`May 11, 2020` - **[immudb v0.6.0-rc1 released!](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases)**

Release v0.6.0-rc1 is our first release to the public. While we were using immudb for quite some time in the [codenotary.io](https://www.codenotary.io) platform, we're thrilled to finally release it to the Open Source community (Apache 2 license).

The release contains 3 components, the main immutable database immudb, a RESTful proxy called immugw and the admin CLI tool immuadmin. immudb is ready to be used on Linux as well as Microsoft Windows.



## How immudb works

#### adding data

When adding data the merkle tree changes as well as shown in the diagram

![the merkle tree changes with every new data](img/immudb-adding-data-diagram.png)

#### checking data consistency

The following diagram explains how data is inserted, verified and consistency checked.

![How immudb data consistency works](img/immudb-consistency-diagram.png)



#### immugw communication

immugw proxies REST client communication and gRPC server interface. For security purposes immugw should not run on the same server as immudb. The following diagram shows how the communication works:

![immugw communication explained](img/immugw-diagram.png)

## Features

#### Simplified API for safe SET/GET

single API call that performs all steps and returns the proofs directly.

#### REST gateway (for legacy systems)

A gRPC REST gateway is a reverse proxy that sits in the middle between the gRPC API and the application.

Other than simply converting the gRPC API to a REST interface, this component will have a built-in verification on query results and will return the verification result directly.

This solution is completely transparent: the client application can use just one endpoint (the REST interface) to perform all operations.
The REST gateway can be also embedded into the immudb binary directly.

#### Drivers for Common Languages

Drivers will soon be available for:

1. Java
2. .net
3. Golang
4. Python
5. Node.js

#### Structured value

Protobuf's [Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any) message type allows callers to use 
messages as embedded types without having their .proto definition. Thus, it will soon be possible to decouple and extend
the value structure. The value, currently a stream of bytes, can be augmented with some client provided metadata. 
This also permits use of an on-demand serialization/deserialization strategy.

The payload includes a timestamp and a value at the moment. In the near future cryptographic signatures will be added as well. 
It will be possible to decouple and extend this in the future. The entire payload contribute to hash generation and is inserted in 
the merkle tree. 

All the complexity is hidden by the SDK.

#### Item References

Enables the insertion of a special entry which references to another item

#### Value timestamp

The server should not set the timestamp, to avoid relying on a non-verifiable âsingle source of truthâ.
Thus, the clients must provide it. The client driver implementation can automatically do that for the user.

#### Primary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data key

#### Secondary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data value

#### Cryptographic signatures

A signature (PKI) provided by the client can be became part of the insertion process

#### Authentication (transport)

Integrated mTLS offers the best approach for machine-to-machine authentication, also providing communications security (entryption) over the transport channel

## Monitor status and performance

### immuadmin CLI

### Performance monitoring (Prometheus)

immudb has a built-in prometheus exporter that publishes all metrics at port 9497 (:9497/metrics) by default. When running a Prometheus instance, you can configure the target like in this example:

```
  - job_name: 'immudbmetrics'
    scrape_interval: 60s
    static_configs:
         - targets: ['my-immudb-server:9497']

```

#### Grafana

There is a Grafana dashboard available as well: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12026

## Real world examples

We already learned about the following use cases from users:

- use immudb to immutably store every update to sensitive database fields (credit card or bank account data) of an existing application database
- store CI/CD recipes in immudb to protect build and deployment pipelines
- store public certificates in immudb
- use immudb as an additional hash storage for digital objects checksums
- store log streams (i. e. audit logs) tamperproof

## FAQ

| Question                                                     | Answer                                                       | Release date    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Where is the Immudb data stored?                             | The data location can be defined using the directory parameter when starting immudb. By default the data is in `/var/lib/immudb` | initial release |
| How is the data structured?                                  | Data is stored in a Key-Value fashion. Data is always appended and never overwritten, so multiple versions of the same Key-Value can exist and can be inspected (by using the History API). | initial release |
| What kind of data can be stored?                             | Any kind of Key-Value of data, values can be json data, configuration data, etc... Clients can choose how to structure data. | initial release |
| What happens to my data if someone tamperes with it?         | immudb is a tamper-evident history system. When data (or the data history) is being tampered, the DB will not able to produce a valid consistency proof, so each client connect to the db will be able to notice the tampering and notify the user. | initial release |
| How can data be backed up?                                   | Currently the database needs to be stopped and the data files copied manually to backup. immudb will provide an APIs to perform online backups and restores in Q3/2020. | initial release |
| How can data be restored?                                    | Backups files can easily restored by stopping the immudb server and replacing the data with the backed up files. If the backup data has been tampered the immudb server will detect that. API based restore is planned for Q3/2020 | initial release |
| Is there a way to incremently backup data?                   | immudb provides stream APIs and data can be streamed in insertion order, that can be easily used to perform incremental backups and incremental restores. | Q3/2020         |
| Is there a way to incremently restore data?                  | (see above)                                                  | Q3/2020         |
| How can the data be replicated to other systems?             | Our goal is to provide a scalable and redundant solution for enterprises. The investigation for the best approach is ongoing and not finalized yet. Our goal is to have it ready shortly after the official enterprise version release | Q3/2020         |
| Would replication stop, when unverifiable data is detected?  | Customers will able to configure the wanted behavior when a unverifiable state is detected across replicas. By default, all valid replicas will able to continue working and replicas with invalid states will be skipped by all clients. | Q3/2020         |
| Somebody changes one value in the database - how can it be detected and reverted? | With replication, it's possible to detect which replica nodes are valid and which are not. If at least a replica node was not tampered data can be easily restored. | Q3/2020         |
| Somebody changes the merkle root entry - how can I recover?  | Each client locally stores the last valid Merkle Tree Root (just 32 bytes of data). When the root of a DB instance is tampered then client will be able to mathematically proof that the provided root is not consistent with the last valid one. If an authenticated backup or a not tampered replica node is available, not-tampered data can be used to recover the Merkle Tree Root to a valid state. | Q3/2020         |
| How is the database protected? outside probes?               | Each client helps in protecting the DB. Special clients (called "agents") can be installed on different systems and continuously monitor the DB. | Q3/2020         |
| How can I monitor database performance?                      | immudb provides realtime metrics that can be collected using Prometheus | initial release |
| How can I monitor database health?                           | immudb provides realtime healthcheck endpoints via API and immu client | initial release |
| How can I monitor database integrity?                        | immudb provides proof APIs and clients and agents can ask for proof in realtime. | initial release |
| How can I monitor database integrity for single objects or specific entries? | immu client has a functionality to authenticate a specific entry at a given point in time. So both last version and the whole history of an item can be verified. | initial release |
| Can I build and distribute an immudb that skips the verification? If yes, how to avoid that? | [CodeNotary](https://www.codenotary.io) team notarizes sources and releases of all immudb components. Check if the release binaries are notarized by vChain.us using [authenticate.codenotary.io](https://authenticate.codenotary.io/org/vchain.us) to prove origin and detect any kind of tampering. | initial release |
| How many databases can I run on a single immudb server?      | We currently support one database, but in future releases there will be support for many databases. | Q3/2020         |
