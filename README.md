### **New**: immudb Coding Challenge - Winter 2020 Edition [#immuchallenge](https://github.com/codenotary/immuchallenge)

---

immudb is not a blockchain, immudb is the **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** with built-in cryptographic proof and verification.
With immudb you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a
tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of sensitive data, for example debit/credit card transactions.
<img align="right" src="img/immudb-mascot-small.png" width="256px"/>

Traditional DB transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.

As such, immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retroactively** of changes to your sensitive data, even
if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using a **Merkle tree structure** internally.

immudb gives you the same **cryptographic verification** of the integrity of data written with **SHA-256** like a classic blockchain without the cost and complexity associated with blockchains today.

immudb has 4 main benefits:

1. **immudb is immutable**. You can add records, but **never change or delete records**.
2. Data stored in immudb is **cryptographically coherent and verifiable**, like blockchains, just without all the complexity and at high speed.
3. Anyone can get **started with immudb in minutes**. Whether you're using node.js, Java, Python, Go, .Net, or any other language. It's very easy to use and you can have your immutable database running in just a few minutes.
4. Finally, immudb is  **Open Source**. You can run it **on premise**, or in the **cloud**. It's completely free. immudb is governed by the Apache 2.0 License.

immudb can be ran on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **Windows**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

## Quickstart

Getting immudb up and running is quite simple. Choose any of following options:

1. [Running immudb in Docker](#running-immudb-in-docker)
2. [Download immudb release binary](#download-immudb-release-binary)
3. [Build immudb by yourself](#build-the-binaries-yourself)
4. [Running as a service](#run-immudb-as-a-service)


### Running immudb in Docker

1. Pull immudb Docker Image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull codenotary/immudb:latest
```

2. Run immudb in a container:

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 3322:3322 -p 9497:9497 --name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest
```

immudb should be up and running, you can check the container logs:

```bash
docker logs immudb
```

### Download immudb release binary

Download latest release binaries from [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases). Then just run immudb as follows:

```bash
# run immudb in the foreground
./immudb

# run immudb in the background
./immudb -d
```

To stop immudb in that case you need to find the process `ps -ax | grep immudb` and then `kill -15 <pid>`. Windows PowerShell would be `Get-Process immudb* | Stop-Process`.

Using non-default configuration:

```bash

## Using immudb

Integrate immudb into your application using official SDKs already available for the following programming languages:

1. Java [immudb4j](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j)
2. Golang [immudb-go](https://docs.immudb.io/immudb/golang.html)
3. .net [immudb4dotnet](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4dotnet)
4. Python [immudb-py](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-py)
5. Node.js [immudb-node](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-node)

We've developed a "language-agnostic SDK" which exposes a REST API for easy consumption by any application.
[immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) may be convenient tool when SDKs are not available for the
programming language you're using, for experimentation, or just because you prefer your app only uses REST endpoints.

For a super quick start, please follow step by step guides for each SDK or pick a basic running sample from [immudb-client-examples](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-client-examples). Otherwise, you can use the immudb CLI tools described below.

## CLI tools

- **immuclient** is the CLI client for immudb. You can read, write data into immudb from the commandline using direct or interactive mode.
- **immuadmin** is the admin CLI for immudb. You can manage immudb and get statistics as well as runtime information.

The latest release binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases)

### Docker

All cli components are also available as docker images on dockerhub.com.

| Component  | Container image                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| immuadmin  | https://hub.docker.com/r/codenotary/immuadmin  |
| immuclient | https://hub.docker.com/r/codenotary/immuclient |

#### Run immuadmin

You can either find immuadmin in the immudb container (/usr/local/bin/immuadmin) or run the docker container to connect to the local immudb.

```
docker run -it --rm --name immuadmin codenotary/immuadmin:latest status
```

#### Run immuclient

You can either find immuclient in the immudb container (/usr/local/bin/immuclient) or run the docker container to connect to the local or remote immudb.

```
docker run -it --rm --name immuclient codenotary/immuclient:latest -a <immudb-host>
```

#### Build the container images yourself

If you want to build the container images yourself, simply clone this repo and run

```
docker build -t myown/immuadmin:latest -f Dockerfile.immuadmin .
docker build -t myown/immuclient:latest -f Dockerfile.immuclient .
```

## Migration from older releases

As for release 0.8 of immudb, which includes multi-key insertions, key-value data needs to be univocally referenced by a monotonic increasing index i.e. internally referred as `ts`. Values are prefixed with the uniquely assigned `ts` value for the entry. Thus, databases created before release 0.8 needs to be migrated.
Under tools folder you will find a simple migration tool which will format data according to the new structure.

### Building migration tool binary

Building migration tool binary is as simple as:

```
go build tools/migration/migration_v0.8.go
```

### How to use migration tool

```
./migration_v0.8 --help
```

```
Usage of ./migration_v0.8:
  -sourceDataDir string
    	immudb data directory to migrate e.g. ./data_v0.7 (default "data_v0.7")
  -targetDataDir string
    	immudb data directory where migrated immudb databases will be stored e.g. ./data_v0.8 (default "data_v0.8")
```

### Migrating existent databases

The migration tool builds new databases by doing a full scan of existent ones. While it's a read-only process for existent databases, doing a backup is always a safe recommendation.

```
./migration_v0.8 -sourceDataDir ./data_v0.7 -targetDataDir ./data_v0.8

2 databases will be migrated

Started migration of data_v0.7/defaultdb to ./data_v0.8/defaultdb.................................................................................COMPLETED!

Started migration of data_v0.7/systemdb to ./data_v0.8/systemdb........COMPLETED!

All databases have been successfully migrated!
```

## How immudb works

Download [immudb short research paper](https://codenotary.io/technologies/immudb/) to have a conceptual understanding of the technical foundations of immudb.

#### adding data

When adding data the merkle tree changes as well as shown in the diagram

![the merkle tree changes with every new data](img/immudb-adding-data-diagram.png)

#### checking data consistency

The following diagram explains how data is inserted, verified and consistency checked.

![How immudb data consistency works](img/immudb-consistency-diagram.png)


#### Structured value

The messages structure allows callers to use key value pairs as embedded payload. Thus, it will soon be possible to decouple and extend
the value structure. The value, currently a stream of bytes, can be augmented with some client provided metadata.
This also permits use of an on-demand serialization/deserialization strategy.

The payload includes a timestamp and a value at the moment. In the near future cryptographic signatures will be added as well, but it's
possible to decouple and extend. The entire payload contribute to hash generation and is inserted in
the merkle tree.

All the complexity is hidden by the SDK.

#### Root signature

Providing `immudb` with a signing key enables the cryptographic root signature.
In this way an auditor for instance or a third party client could verify the authenticity of the returned root hash / index pair after calling `currentRoot` gRPC method.
Here the gRPC message definitions:
```proto
message Root {
	RootIndex payload = 1;
	Signature signature = 2;
}

message RootIndex {
	uint64 index = 1;
	bytes root = 2;
}

message Signature {
	bytes signature = 1;
	bytes publicKey = 2;
}
```
It's possible to use the environment `IMMUDB_SIGNING_KEY` or `--signingKey` immudb flag.

To generate a valid key it's possible to use `openssl` tool:
```.bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out my.key
```
Immuclient and [immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) are shipped with auditor capabilities.
To obtain the advantages of using the signed root in combination with the auditor it's possible to launch:
* immuclient with auditor capabilities:
```bash
immuclient audit-mode --audit-username {immudb-username} --audit-password {immudb-pw} --audit-signature validate
```
* with [immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) with auditor capabilities:
```bash
./immugw --audit --audit-username {immudb-username} --audit-password {immudb-pw} --audit-signature validate
```

#### Item References

Enables the insertion of a special entry which references to another item

#### Value timestamp

The server should not set the timestamp, to avoid relying on a non-verifiable ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù.
Thus, the clients must provide it. The client driver implementation can automatically do that for the user.

#### Primary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data key

#### Secondary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data value

#### Cryptographic signatures

A signature (PKI) provided by the client can be became part of the insertion process

#### Authentication (transport)

Integrated mTLS offers the best approach for machine-to-machine authentication, also providing communications security (entryption) over the transport channel

## Real world examples

We already learned about the following use cases from users:

- use immudb to immutably store every update to sensitive database fields (credit card or bank account data) of an existing application database
- store CI/CD recipes in immudb to protect build and deployment pipelines
- store public certificates in immudb
- use immudb as an additional hash storage for digital objects checksums
- store log streams (i. e. audit logs) tamperproof

### Companies using immudb

[Opvizor](https://www.opvizor.com) - immutable log (syslog) solution for VMware vSphere

[eSoftThings ](https://www.esoftthings.com/en/)

[Greentube](https://www.greentube.com/)

## Multiple databases

It is possible to create and use many databases. There is no hardcoded limit on the number of database immudb can handle, but keep in mind that for every database created, 4 more file descriptor will be used. Also, the database name must be shorter that 128 bytes, in order to comply with filesystem limitations. This is because every database is stored in a directory which has the same name of the database. For the same reason, special characters (such as `/`) in the database name must be avoided.

The default number of open file per process on modern linux systems is usually 1024. Thats mean that without increasing that number, immudb is limited to about 250 databases. It's easy to increase that limit.

If you are using systemd services, you only need to set `LimitNOFILE=65536` in the service file, and restart the service.

With systemV init, you have to put `ulimit -n 65536` in your init file, before launching immudb.

It is also possible to modify `/etc/security/limits.conf`, which sets the system defaults.

If you are using a dedicated immudb user, just add:
```
# /etc/security/limits.conf
immudb    hard    nofile      65536
immudb    soft    nofile      65536
```
