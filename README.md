immudb is a **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** for systems and applications. Written in Go.
With immudb you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a
tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of sensitive data, for example debit/credit card transactions.
<img align="right" src="img/immudb-mascot-small.png" width="256px"/>

Traditional DB transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.

As such, immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retroactively** of changes to your sensitive data, even
if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using a **Merkle tree structure** internally.

immudb gives you the same **cryptographic verification** of the integrity of data written with **SHA-256** like a classic blockchain without the cost and complexity associated with blockchains today.

immudb has 4 main benefits:

1. **immudb is immutable**. You can add records, but **never change or delete records**.
2. Data stored in immudb is **cryptographically coherent and verifiable**, like blockchains, just without all the complexity and at high speed.
3. Anyone can get **started with immudb in minutes**. Whether you're using node.js, Java, Python, Go, .Net, or any other language. It's very easy to use and you can have your immutable database running in just a few minutes.
4. Finally, immudb is  **Open Source**. You can run it **on premise**, or in the **cloud**. It's completely free. immudb is governed by the Apache 2.0 License.

immudb can be ran on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **Windows**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

## Quickstart

Getting `immudb` up and running is quite simple. Choose any of following options:

1. [Running `immudb` in Docker](#immudb-docker)
2. [Download `immudb` release binary](#immudb-binary)
3. [Build `immudb` by yourself](#immudb-build-from-source)

### Running `immudb` in Docker

1. Pull `immudb` Docker Image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull codenotary/immudb:latest
```

2. Run `immudb` in a container:

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 3322:3322 -p 9497:9497 --name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest
```

`immudb` should be up and running, you can check the container logs:

```bash
docker logs immudb
```

### Download `immudb` release binary

Download latest release binaries from [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases). Then just run `immudb` as follows:

```bash
# run immudb in the foreground
./immudb

# run immudb in the background
./immudb -d
```

To stop immudb Ã®n that case you need to find the process `ps -ax | grep immudb` and then `kill -15 <pid>`. Windows PowerShell would be `Get-Process immudb* | Stop-Process`.

## Using `immudb`

Integrate `immudb` into your application using official SDKs already available for the following programming languages:

1. Java [immudb4j](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j)
3. Golang [immudb-go](https://docs.immudb.io/immudb/golang.html)
2. .net (in progress)
4. Python (planned)
5. Node.js (planned)

We've developed a "language-agnostic SDK" which exposes a REST API for easy consumption by any application.
[immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) may be convenient tool when SDKs are not available for the
programming language you're using, for experimentation, or just because you prefer your app only uses REST endpoints.

For a super quick start, please follow step by step guides for each SDK or pick a basic running sample from [immudb-client-examples](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-client-examples). Otherwise, you can use the immudb CLI tools described below.

## CLI tools

- **immuclient** is the CLI client for `immudb`. You can read, write data into immudb from the commandline using direct or interactive mode.
- **immuadmin** is the admin CLI for `immudb` and `immugw`. You can install and manage the service installation for both components and get statistics as well as runtime information.

The latest release binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases)

### Run immudb as a service (using immuadmin)

Please make sure to build or download the `immudb` and `immuadmin` component and save them in the same work directory when installing the service.

```
# install immudb service
./immuadmin service immudb install

# check current immudb service status
./immuadmin service immudb status

# stop immudb service
./immuadmin service immudb stop

# start immudb service
./immuadmin service immudb start
```

The linux service is using the following defaults:

| File or configuration   | location                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| all configuration files | /etc/immudb                |
| all data files          | /var/lib/immudb            |
| pid file                | /var/lib/immudb/immudb.pid |
| log files               | /var/log/immudb            |

The FreeBSD service is using the following defaults:

| File or configuration   | location            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| all configuration files | /etc/immudb         |
| all data files          | /var/lib/immudb     |

## Why immudb

immudb has been developed with performance, scalability and versatility in mind. The user feedback has shown that they love the very high throughput and being able to store hashes as well as data. They see it as a great alternative to using a blockchain or ledger service.

That makes immudb fit to store changes to other database fields (like Microsoft SQL or MongoDB) in a tamperproof fashion.

You can find an example video here:

[![With immudb you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes indelibly in a the tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of, say, your debit/credit transactions.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/rQ4iZAM14m0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ4iZAM14m0 "track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases")

## How immudb works

Download [immmudb short research paper](https://codenotary.io/technologies/immudb/) to have a conceptual understanding of the technical foundations of `immudb`.

#### adding data

When adding data the merkle tree changes as well as shown in the diagram

![the merkle tree changes with every new data](img/immudb-adding-data-diagram.png)

#### checking data consistency

The following diagram explains how data is inserted, verified and consistency checked.

![How immudb data consistency works](img/immudb-consistency-diagram.png)


#### Structured value

Protobuf's [Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any) message type allows callers to use
messages as embedded types without having their .proto definition. Thus, it will soon be possible to decouple and extend
the value structure. The value, currently a stream of bytes, can be augmented with some client provided metadata.
This also permits use of an on-demand serialization/deserialization strategy.

The payload includes a timestamp and a value at the moment. In the near future cryptographic signatures will be added as well.
It will be possible to decouple and extend this in the future. The entire payload contribute to hash generation and is inserted in
the merkle tree.

All the complexity is hidden by the SDK.

#### Item References

Enables the insertion of a special entry which references to another item

#### Value timestamp

The server should not set the timestamp, to avoid relying on a non-verifiable âsingle source of truthâ.
Thus, the clients must provide it. The client driver implementation can automatically do that for the user.

#### Primary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data key

#### Secondary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data value

#### Cryptographic signatures

A signature (PKI) provided by the client can be became part of the insertion process

#### Authentication (transport)

Integrated mTLS offers the best approach for machine-to-machine authentication, also providing communications security (entryption) over the transport channel

### Performance monitoring (Prometheus)

immudb has a built-in prometheus exporter that publishes all metrics at port 9497 (:9497/metrics) by default. When running a Prometheus instance, you can configure the target like in this example:

```
  - job_name: 'immudbmetrics'
    scrape_interval: 60s
    static_configs:
         - targets: ['my-immudb-server:9497']

```

#### Grafana

There is a Grafana dashboard available as well: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12026

## Real world examples

We already learned about the following use cases from users:

- use immudb to immutably store every update to sensitive database fields (credit card or bank account data) of an existing application database
- store CI/CD recipes in immudb to protect build and deployment pipelines
- store public certificates in immudb
- use immudb as an additional hash storage for digital objects checksums
- store log streams (i. e. audit logs) tamperproof
