immudb is a **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** for systems and applications. Written in Go.
With immudb you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a
tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of sensitive data, for example debit/credit card transactions.
<img align="right" src="img/immudb-mascot-small.png" width="256px"/>

Traditional DB transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.

As such, immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retroactively** of changes to your sensitive data, even
if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using a **Merkle tree structure** internally.

immudb gives you the same **cryptographic verification** of the integrity of data written with **SHA-256** like a classic blockchain without the cost and complexity associated with blockchains today.

immudb has 4 main benefits:

1. **immudb is immutable**. You can add records, but **never change or delete records**.
2. Data stored in immudb is **cryptographically coherent and verifiable**, like blockchains, just without all the complexity and at high speed.
3. Anyone can get **started with immudb in minutes**. Whether you're using node.js, Java, Python, Go, .Net, or any other language. It's very easy to use and you can have your immutable database running in just a few minutes.
4. Finally, immudb is  **Open Source**. You can run it **on premise**, or in the **cloud**. It's completely free. immudb is governed by the Apache 2.0 License.

immudb can be ran on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **Windows**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.

## Quickstart

Getting immudb up and running is quite simple. Choose any of following options:

1. [Running immudb in Docker](#running-immudb-in-docker)
2. [Download immudb release binary](#download-immudb-release-binary)
3. [Build immudb by yourself](#build-the-binaries-yourself)
4. [Running as a service](#run-immudb-as-a-service)


### Running immudb in Docker

1. Pull immudb Docker Image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull codenotary/immudb:latest
```

2. Run immudb in a container:

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 3322:3322 -p 9497:9497 --name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest
```

immudb should be up and running, you can check the container logs:

```bash
docker logs immudb
```

### Download immudb release binary

Download latest release binaries from [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases). Then just run immudb as follows:

```bash
# run immudb in the foreground
./immudb

# run immudb in the background
./immudb -d
```

To stop immudb Ã®n that case you need to find the process `ps -ax | grep immudb` and then `kill -15 <pid>`. Windows PowerShell would be `Get-Process immudb* | Stop-Process`.

## Using immudb

Integrate immudb into your application using official SDKs already available for the following programming languages:

1. Java [immudb4j](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j)
2. Golang [immudb-go](https://docs.immudb.io/immudb/golang.html)
3. .net [immudb4dotnet](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4dotnet)
4. Python [immudb-py](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-py)
5. Node.js [immudb-node](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-node)

We've developed a "language-agnostic SDK" which exposes a REST API for easy consumption by any application.
[immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) may be convenient tool when SDKs are not available for the
programming language you're using, for experimentation, or just because you prefer your app only uses REST endpoints.

For a super quick start, please follow step by step guides for each SDK or pick a basic running sample from [immudb-client-examples](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-client-examples). Otherwise, you can use the immudb CLI tools described below.

## CLI tools

- **immuclient** is the CLI client for immudb. You can read, write data into immudb from the commandline using direct or interactive mode.
- **immuadmin** is the admin CLI for immudb. You can manage immudb and get statistics as well as runtime information.

The latest release binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases)

### Docker

All cli components are also available as docker images on dockerhub.com.

| Component  | Container image                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| immuadmin  | https://hub.docker.com/r/codenotary/immuadmin  |
| immuclient | https://hub.docker.com/r/codenotary/immuclient |

#### Run immuadmin

You can either find immuadmin in the immudb container (/usr/local/bin/immuadmin) or run the docker container to connect to the local immudb.

```
docker run -it --rm --name immuadmin codenotary/immuadmin:latest status
```

#### Run immuclient

You can either find immuclient in the immudb container (/usr/local/bin/immuclient) or run the docker container to connect to the local or remote immudb.

```
docker run -it --rm --name immuclient codenotary/immuclient:latest -a <immudb-host>
```

#### Build the container images yourself

If you want to build the container images yourself, simply clone this repo and run

```
docker build -t myown/immuadmin:latest -f Dockerfile.immuadmin .
docker build -t myown/immuclient:latest -f Dockerfile.immuclient .
```

## Migration from older releases

As for release 0.8 of immudb, which includes multi-key insertions, key-value data needs to be univocally referenced by a monotonic increasing index i.e. internally referred as `ts`. Values are prefixed with the uniquely assigned `ts` value for the entry. Thus, databases created before release 0.8 needs to be migrated.
Under tools folder you will find a simple migration tool which will format data according to the new structure.

### Building migration tool binary

Building migration tool binary is as simple as:

```
go build tools/migration/migration_v0.8.go
```

### How to use migration tool

```
./migration_v0.8 --help
```

```
Usage of ./migration_v0.8:
  -sourceDataDir string
    	immudb data directory to migrate e.g. ./data_v0.7 (default "data_v0.7")
  -targetDataDir string
    	immudb data directory where migrated immudb databases will be stored e.g. ./data_v0.8 (default "data_v0.8")
```

### Migrating existent databases

The migration tool builds new databases by doing a full scan of existent ones. While it's a read-only process for existent databases, doing a backup is always a safe recommendation.

```
./migration_v0.8 -sourceDataDir ./data_v0.7 -targetDataDir ./data_v0.8

2 databases will be migrated

Started migration of data_v0.7/defaultdb to ./data_v0.8/defaultdb.................................................................................COMPLETED!

Started migration of data_v0.7/systemdb to ./data_v0.8/systemdb........COMPLETED!

All databases have been successfully migrated!
```


## Why immudb

immudb has been developed with performance, scalability and versatility in mind. The user feedback has shown that they love the very high throughput and being able to store hashes as well as data. They see it as a great alternative to using a blockchain or ledger service.

That makes immudb fit to store changes to other database fields (like Microsoft SQL or MongoDB) in a tamperproof fashion.

You can find an example video here:

[![With immudb you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes indelibly in a the tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of, say, your debit/credit transactions.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/rQ4iZAM14m0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ4iZAM14m0 "track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases")

## How immudb works

Download [immmudb short research paper](https://codenotary.io/technologies/immudb/) to have a conceptual understanding of the technical foundations of immudb.

#### adding data

When adding data the merkle tree changes as well as shown in the diagram

![the merkle tree changes with every new data](img/immudb-adding-data-diagram.png)

#### checking data consistency

The following diagram explains how data is inserted, verified and consistency checked.

![How immudb data consistency works](img/immudb-consistency-diagram.png)


#### Structured value

The messages structure allows callers to use key value pairs as embedded payload. Thus, it will soon be possible to decouple and extend
the value structure. The value, currently a stream of bytes, can be augmented with some client provided metadata.
This also permits use of an on-demand serialization/deserialization strategy.

The payload includes a timestamp and a value at the moment. In the near future cryptographic signatures will be added as well, but it's
possible to decouple and extend. The entire payload contribute to hash generation and is inserted in
the merkle tree.

All the complexity is hidden by the SDK.

#### Root signature

Providing `immudb` with a signing key enables the cryptographic root signature.
In this way an auditor for instance or a third party client could verify the authenticity of the returned root hash / index pair after calling `currentRoot` gRPC method.
Here the gRPC message definitions:
```proto
message Root {
	RootIndex payload = 1;
	Signature signature = 2;
}

message RootIndex {
	uint64 index = 1;
	bytes root = 2;
}

message Signature {
	bytes signature = 1;
	bytes publicKey = 2;
}
```
It's possible to use the environment `IMMUDB_SIGNING_KEY` or `--signingKey` immudb flag.

To generate a valid key it's possible to use `openssl` tool:
```.bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out my.key
```
Immuclient and [immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) are shipped with auditor capabilities.
To obtain the advantages of using the signed root in combination with the auditor it's possible to launch:
* immuclient with auditor capabilities:
```bash
immuclient audit-mode --audit-username {immudb-username} --audit-password {immudb-pw} --audit-signature validate
```
* with [immugw](https://github.com/codenotary/immugw) with auditor capabilities:
```bash
./immugw --audit --audit-username {immudb-username} --audit-password {immudb-pw} --audit-signature validate
```

#### Item References

Enables the insertion of a special entry which references to another item

#### Value timestamp

The server should not set the timestamp, to avoid relying on a non-verifiable âsingle source of truthâ.
Thus, the clients must provide it. The client driver implementation can automatically do that for the user.

#### Primary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data key

#### Secondary Index

Index enables queries and search based on the data value

#### Cryptographic signatures

A signature (PKI) provided by the client can be became part of the insertion process

#### Authentication (transport)

Integrated mTLS offers the best approach for machine-to-machine authentication, also providing communications security (entryption) over the transport channel

## Monitor status and performance

### Performance monitoring (Prometheus)

immudb has a built-in prometheus exporter that publishes all metrics at port 9497 (:9497/metrics) by default. When running a Prometheus instance, you can configure the target like in this example:

```
  - job_name: 'immudbmetrics'
    scrape_interval: 60s
    static_configs:
         - targets: ['my-immudb-server:9497']

```

#### Grafana

There is a Grafana dashboard available as well: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12026

| How can the data be replicated to other systems?                                             | Our goal is to provide a scalable and redundant solution for enterprises. The investigation for the best approach is ongoing and not finalized yet. Our goal is to have it ready shortly after the official enterprise version release                                                                                                                                                                    | Q3/2020         |
| Would replication stop, when unverifiable data is detected?                                  | Customers will able to configure the wanted behavior when a unverifiable state is detected across replicas. By default, all valid replicas will able to continue working and replicas with invalid states will be skipped by all clients.                                                                                                                                                                 | Q3/2020         |
| Somebody changes one value in the database - how can it be detected and reverted?            | With replication, it's possible to detect which replica nodes are valid and which are not. If at least a replica node was not tampered data can be easily restored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Q3/2020         |
| Somebody changes the merkle root entry - how can I recover?                                  | Each client locally stores the last valid Merkle Tree Root (just 32 bytes of data). When the root of a DB instance is tampered then client will be able to mathematically proof that the provided root is not consistent with the last valid one. If an authenticated backup or a not tampered replica node is available, not-tampered data can be used to recover the Merkle Tree Root to a valid state. | Q3/2020         |
| How is the database protected? outside probes?                                               | Each client helps in protecting the DB. Special clients (called "agents") can be installed on different systems and continuously monitor the DB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Q3/2020         |
