# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/immudb-mascot.svg)

Welcome to the immudb documentation. Great to see you here!

immudb is a new type of database, an immutable one.  Immutability means that the history of data in immudb is preserved and can't be changed without clients noticing those changes. It can be used to ensure that data is always available, accurate and auditable.

immudb can be used both as a key-value store, or as a relational database (SQL).

immudb is written in and is a part of the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language ecosystem.
