// At completion of each series of extended-query messages, the frontend should issue a Sync message. This parameterless
// message causes the backend to close the current transaction if it's not inside a BEGIN/COMMIT transaction block
// (“close” meaning to commit if no error, or roll back if error). Then a ReadyForQuery response is issued. The purpose
// of Sync is to provide a resynchronization point for error recovery. When an error is detected while processing any
// extended-query message, the backend issues ErrorResponse, then reads and discards messages until a Sync is reached,
// then issues ReadyForQuery and returns to normal message processing. (But note that no skipping occurs if an error is
// detected while processing Sync — this ensures that there is one and only one ReadyForQuery sent for each Sync.)
