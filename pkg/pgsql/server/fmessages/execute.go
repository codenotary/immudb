// Once a portal exists, it can be executed using an Execute message. The Execute message specifies the portal name
// (empty string denotes the unnamed portal) and a maximum result-row count (zero meaning “fetch all rows”).
// The result-row count is only meaningful for portals containing commands that return row sets; in other cases the
// command is always executed to completion, and the row count is ignored. The possible responses to Execute are the
// same as those described above for queries issued via simple query protocol, except that Execute doesn't cause
// ReadyForQuery or RowDescription to be issued.
//
// If Execute terminates before completing the execution of a portal (due to reaching a nonzero result-row count), it
// will send a PortalSuspended message; the appearance of this message tells the frontend that another Execute should be
// issued against the same portal to complete the operation. The CommandComplete message indicating completion of the
// source SQL command is not sent until the portal's execution is completed. Therefore, an Execute phase is always
// terminated by the appearance of exactly one of these messages: CommandComplete, EmptyQueryResponse (if the portal was
// created from an empty query string), ErrorResponse, or PortalSuspended.
